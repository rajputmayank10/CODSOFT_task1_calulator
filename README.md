# CODSOFT_task1_calulator
This is a straightforward Python command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users interact with the program via the command line, choosing operations and entering numbers.

Features
Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides the first number by the second, with basic error handling for division by zero.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Error Handling
Invalid Input: If a user selects an invalid operation or enters non-numeric values, the program will display an error message and prompt the user to enter valid inputs.
Division by Zero: If the user attempts to divide by zero, Python will raise a ZeroDivisionError. This should ideally be handled in a production environment, but this script assumes basic input and does not handle this case explicitly.
Code Structure
add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y.
multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x divided by y.
